# John Conway's Game of Life
This project is a JavaScript Implementation of John Conway's Game of Life. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton/no-player game, in-which cells on a 2D plane can either be alive or dead. The life status of each cell is determined by its eight neighbouring cell values, and follows the following four rules;

1. Live cells with less than two live neighbouring cells will die due to under-population.
2. A live cell which has either two or three live neighbouring cells, will stay alive for the next generation.
3. Live cells with more than three live neighbouring cells will die due to overpopulation.
4. If a dead cell has three live neighbours it will become alive through reproduction.
